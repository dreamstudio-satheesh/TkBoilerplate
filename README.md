# TkBoilerplate
Python boilerplate for building desktop applications with Tkinter


## Project Purpose
This repository provides a standardized Python boilerplate for building desktop applications with Tkinter. The goal is to simplify the process of creating apps like ERP systems, POS, or billing software by offering a structured and secure starting point. Key features include:

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture**: For clean and maintainable code.
- **User Authentication**: Ready-to-use authentication system.
- **Security Best Practices**: Secure handling of user data and application logic.
- **Documentation**: Clear and concise guides for setup and usage.

## Features
- **Tkinter-based UI**: Fast and simple GUI development.
- **Authentication Module**: Built-in user authentication for secure access.
- **Modular Structure**: Easily extendable for additional features.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Clear instructions to help you get started quickly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package manager)

### Create a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment ensures a clean Python environment for your project. Follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Verify the virtual environment is active:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   The Python version displayed should match your virtual environment.

### Directory Structure
```
project/
|-- venv/               # Virtual environment directory
|-- app/
|   |-- models/         # Data models
|   |-- views/          # UI components
|   |-- controllers/    # Application logic
|-- requirements.txt    # Dependency list
|-- main.py             # Entry point for the app
|-- README.md           # Documentation
```

### Running the Application
1. Activate your virtual environment (if not already activated).
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
